next-generation / angularjs flickr duplicate finder

easily find and tag duplicate images in your flickr account. currently
uses filename and date_taken timestamp to identify duplicates, simple
but often quiet effective. inspired by the now discontinued
[flickrdupfinder] project.

oauth authenticated access to flickr is proxied via my own instance of
oauthd running on heroku:
